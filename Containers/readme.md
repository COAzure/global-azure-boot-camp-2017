# Community Content - Docker

This folder contains content introducing Docker and demonstrating how to use it to run containerized apps in Azure. The content is divided into three sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Running Docker Containers in the Azure Container Service (HOL)
- Session 3 - Docker Orchestration and the Azure Container Service (HOL)

The HOLs may be presented as hands-on labs or as demos accompanying the slide deck.
